    <h2>Sorting and Categorizing:</h2>
    <p>
        Grouping objects based on size, color, shape, or purpose.
        Learning to identify similarities and differences among objects.
    </p>
    <div class="containerSort">

        Interactive Teaching Techniques
        Play-Based Learning:

        Engage children with playful activities like dice games, puzzles, or hopscotch, where they count movements or steps.

        Use songs and rhymes incorporating numbers to make learning fun and memorable.

        Nature-Based Math:

        Count leaves, flowers, or stones during outdoor activities.

        Explore symmetry and shapes found in the environment, like spider webs or tree branches.

        Story-Based Learning:

        Include counting or sorting in stories, such as "Five Little Monkeys" or "The Very Hungry Caterpillar."

        Encourage problem-solving by asking questions: “How many apples does the caterpillar eat on Tuesday?”

        Building Activities:

        Use building blocks to teach spatial awareness and problem-solving.

        Create towers or patterns with blocks to understand size and sequence.
