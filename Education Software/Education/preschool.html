    <h2>Counting and Number Recognition:</h2>
    <p>
        Teaching children to count sequentially (1, 2, 3…) using objects like toys, blocks, or snacks.
        Recognizing numbers visually and associating them with quantities.
    </p>

    <div id="gameContainer">
        <h1>Counting Game</h1>
        <p id="instruction">How many <span id="objectName">toys</span> do you see?</p>
        <div id="objectDisplay"></div>
        <div id="answerButtons"></div>
        <p id="resultMessage"></p>
        <button id="nextButton" style="display: none;">Next</button>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Shapes and Patterns:</h2>
    <p>
        Identifying and naming basic shapes (circle, square, triangle, etc.).
        Creating and recognizing repeating patterns, such as color or shape sequences.
    </p>

    <div id="gameContainerShapes">
        <h1>Shapes Game</h1>
        <p id="instruction">What is the name of this shape?</p>
        <div id="shapeDisplay"></div>
        <div id="answerButtonsShape"></div>
        <p id="resultMessageShape"></p>
        <button id="nextButtonShape" style="display: none;">Next</button>
    </div>

    <h2>Sorting and Categorizing:</h2>
    <p>
        Grouping objects based on size, color, shape, or purpose.
        Learning to identify similarities and differences among objects.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Spatial Awareness:</h2>
    <p>
        Understanding positional concepts like "above," "below," "beside," and "inside."
        Exploring distance, direction, and relationships between objects.
    </p>

    <h2>Measurement:</h2>
    <p>
        Introducing concepts of length, weight, and capacity using hands-on activities like pouring water or comparing heights.
    </p>

        Interactive Teaching Techniques
        Play-Based Learning:

        Engage children with playful activities like dice games, puzzles, or hopscotch, where they count movements or steps.

        Use songs and rhymes incorporating numbers to make learning fun and memorable.

        Nature-Based Math:

        Count leaves, flowers, or stones during outdoor activities.

        Explore symmetry and shapes found in the environment, like spider webs or tree branches.

        Story-Based Learning:

        Include counting or sorting in stories, such as "Five Little Monkeys" or "The Very Hungry Caterpillar."

        Encourage problem-solving by asking questions: “How many apples does the caterpillar eat on Tuesday?”

        Building Activities:

        Use building blocks to teach spatial awareness and problem-solving.

        Create towers or patterns with blocks to understand size and sequence.
